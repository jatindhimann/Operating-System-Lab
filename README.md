Getting Started
Prerequisites
To compile and run this project, you need:

A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
Standard Template Library (STL) support
Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/operating-system-algorithms.git
cd operating-system-algorithms
Build the project:

sh
Copy code
g++ -o os_algorithms main.cpp CPU_Scheduling_algorithms/*.cpp Page_Replacement_algorithms/*.cpp Memory_Management/*.cpp Disk_Scheduling/*.cpp Deadlocks/*.cpp
Usage
Run the compiled executable:

sh
Copy code
./os_algorithms
Follow the on-screen menu to select the desired algorithm and input the necessary parameters.

Example
Select CPU Scheduling Algorithms:
sh
Copy code
1. CPU Scheduling Algorithms
Choose a specific scheduling algorithm, such as FCFS:
sh
Copy code
1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
The program will then prompt you to enter the required data and display the results.
