<h1>Operating System Algorithms</h1>
<p>This project implements a variety of operating system algorithms, covering CPU scheduling, deadlock detection, page replacement, disk scheduling, and memory management. Each category provides several algorithm choices for user selection through a simple menu-driven interface.The main thing is the it asks the users if they want to add their own inputs or take input that is already stored in corresponding text file</p>
